This project offers an end-to-end pipeline to extract and analyze reviews from an e-commerce website. The high-level overview of the process is as follows -
1) Review Scraper: This module scrapes reviews for products from an e-commerce website and stores them in a database. As an example, we have used a popular Indian e-commerce website that sells cosmetic products. The end-goal is to schedule the daily, automated running of this module using CRON.
2) Keyword Extraction: This module extracts the scraped reviews and runs a keyword analysis on them. This analysis is performed by first cleaning/pre-processing the extracted data and then using Scrapy to extract bigrams/trigrams from the data along with a sentiment score for them. The aim of this is to be able to pinpoint highlights and low-points of a customer's experience with a product.
3) Analysis: This module will offer further analytics on the scraped reviews/extracted keywords. The features for this have not been planned out and are still being thought out. The end-goal would be to serve up this project as a dashboard that could be used to deliver insights on the customer experience while using a product which would hopefully shape future improvements for the product.
